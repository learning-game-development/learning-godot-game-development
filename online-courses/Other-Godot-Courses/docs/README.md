# Documentation

The documents folder is for game designs, any notes as well as the game manual, dailogs and game story.

Try one of these static site generators for your documentation:

- [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
- [Docusaurus][docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io)

The documentation can then be hosted as part of your source code repository:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
- [Codeberg Pages](https://codeberg.page)
- [GitLab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/pages/)
